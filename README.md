# belly-button-challenge

For this week's challenge, data sets were provided that researched bacterial presence within various subjects belly buttons in a study
completed by NC State. The goal of this weeks activity was to use D3 and JavaScript to extract and prepare data from a JSON file and
then use that data to create an interactive dashboard that included the following:
- A dropdown bar that included each subject name id
- A bar chart that included each subjects, where applicable, top 10 most occuring bacterial cultures
- A bubble chart that displayed each culture and was sized by presence within each sample
- (BONUS) an interactve gauge that displayed the wash frequency of each subject

*DEVELOPER NOTE: ALL CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN WITHIN app.js, bonus.js will return 404 error (This is expected).
